# react-development
Project that supports teaching of react development.

Consider this a react-sandbox that will apply knowledge on react and a basic setup of css tooling.

For the time being I am excluding examples with real data (fetch/axios requests), redux/flux and also hooks.

This sandbox is composed by four different projects:

* <b>`calculator`</b> - simple non-cientific calculator
* <b>`filterable-table`</b> - simple table that you can filter using a checkbox and an input
* <b>`todo`</b> - simple todo list that you can add and remove items.
* <b>`metronome`</b>

Feel free to share your thoughts and give suggestions :)
